Installation
------------

1.  Configure PowerDNS:

        webserver-address=...
        webserver-allow-from=...
        webserver-port=...
        experimental-json-interface=yes
        experimental-api-key=...

2.  Clone this repo to somewhere *outside* of your default Apache document root.

3.  Create a postgresql user and database.

        createuser -P dnsui-user
        createdb -O dnsui-user dnsui-db

4.  Import the database schema from `schema.sql`:

        psql -U dnsui-user dnsui-db < schema.sql

5.  Add the following directives to your Apache configuration (eg. virtual host config):

        DocumentRoot /path/to/dnsui/public_html
        DirectoryIndex init.php
        FallbackResource /init.php

6.  Set up authnz_ldap for your virtual host (or any other authentication module that will pass on an Auth-user
    variable to the application).

7.  Copy the file `config/config-sample.ini` to `config/config.ini` and edit the settings as required.

8.  Set `scripts/ldap_update.php` to run on a regular cron job.

Usage
-----

Anyone in the LDAP group defined under `admin_group_cn` in `config/config.ini` will be able to add and modify all zones.
They will also be able to grant access under "User access" for any zone to any number of users.
