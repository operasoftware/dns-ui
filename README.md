Opera DNS UI
============

A tool to manage a PowerDNS authoritative server in a corporate LDAP-driven environment.

Features
--------

* Connects to PowerDNS via its JSON API.
* Allows login managed by LDAP server.
* Create zones; add, edit and delete records.
* Grant multiple users access to administer a zone.
* Lower access level that allows to view a zone and *request* changes.
* Provides its own JSON API for making changes to DNS records.
* Keeps a changelog of all DNS changes done through it.
* (Optionally) export all zones as bind-format zone files and store changes in git.

Demo
----

You can view the DNS UI in action on the [demonstration server](https://dnsui.xiven.com/).

Use one of the following sets of username / password credentials to log in:

* testuser / testuser - normal user with admin access granted to a few domains
* testadmin / testadmin - admin user

All data on this demonstration server is reset nightly at 00:00 UTC.

Compatibility
-------------

The current version is only compatible with PowerDNS 4.0.4 and higher. Previous 4.0.x versions suffer from a critical API bug related to TTL values.

As another option, you can use PowerDNS 3 with
[Opera DNS UI v0.1.3](https://github.com/operasoftware/dns-ui/releases/tag/v0.1.3), but the 0.1 version of the DNS UI will not receive any new features or non-critical fixes.

Requirements
------------

* Apache 2.2.18+ / nginx
* PHP 5.6+
* PHP intl (Internationalization Functions) extension
* PHP JSON extension
* PHP CURL extension
* PHP Multibyte String extension
* PHP LDAP extension
* PHP PDO_PGSQL extension
* PostgreSQL database
* PowerDNS authoritative server 4.0.4+

Installation
------------

1.  Configure PowerDNS:

        webserver=yes
        webserver-address=...
        webserver-allow-from=...
        webserver-port=...
        api=yes
        api-key=...

2.  Clone this repo to somewhere *outside* of your default web server document root.

3.  Create a postgresql user and database.

        createuser -P dnsui-user
        createdb -O dnsui-user dnsui-db

4.  Add the following directives to your web server configuration (eg. virtual host config):

    *   Apache:

            DocumentRoot /path/to/dnsui/public_html
            DirectoryIndex init.php
            FallbackResource /init.php
            AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

        [Full Apache virtualhost example](https://github.com/operasoftware/dns-ui/wiki/Example-configuration:-apache)

    *   nginx:

            root /path/to/dnsui/public_html;
            index init.php;
            location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ @php;
            }
            location @php {
                rewrite ^/(.*)$ /init.php/$1 last;
            }
            location /init.php {
                fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock ;
                include /etc/nginx/snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            }

        [Full nginx server example](https://github.com/operasoftware/dns-ui/wiki/Example-configuration:-nginx)

5.  Set up authentication 

    * Either using the old-style way using an authentication module for your virtual host (eg. authnz_ldap for Apache).

    * Or using HTML form-based authentication using LDAP by setting form_based = "ldap" in config.ini and enabling and configuring LDAP there as well.

6.  Copy the file `config/config-sample.ini` to `config/config.ini` and edit the settings as required.

7.  Set `scripts/ldap_update.php` to run on a regular cron job.

Usage
-----

Anyone in the LDAP group defined under `admin_group_cn` in `config/config.ini` will be able to add and modify all zones.
They will also be able to grant access under "User access" for any zone to any number of users.

API
---

By going to the URL `/api/v2` with your web browser you can see documentation of the rest API, including all of the
available API methods. [See this on the demo server](https://dnsui.xiven.com/api/v2).
